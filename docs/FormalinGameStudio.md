## Dead Road Smoke
​
Dead Road Smoke is a lightweight e-sport type of mobile game. Player's reacting between brain and finger is very important in this game. The story background is Zombie + Western stye. We use 3D pixel-like retro art design and a tons of blood splashing, to make pleasant feeling to kill the zombies!

## Wagon Shootout

Wagon Shootout, the fast shooting game will push you to the edge for reading and then typing it as fast as possible so you can shoot the bandits coming towards you while you are running away on a horse carriage.

## Baseball Warriors 

Baseball Warriors is the first sport simulation idle game in the world. The basic idea here is that you are the manager of a baseball team composed entirely of characters from the popular Chinese Romance Of The Three Kingdoms stories. In most of the game’s modes, you don’t actually control any of your players. Instead, you choose who you want in each position on the field and the game will play out for you. It’s pretty hands-off, but if you want to get in on the action, there’s a Homerun Derby mode where you get to control the batter.
