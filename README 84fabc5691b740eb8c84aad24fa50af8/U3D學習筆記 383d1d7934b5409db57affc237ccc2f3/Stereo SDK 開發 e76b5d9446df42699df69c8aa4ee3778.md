# Stereo SDK 開發

The Stereo SDK provides easy-to-use components for Unity developers to create glass-free 3D content. These components empower developers with flexibility to build 3D content from scratch or convert existing projects to support glass-free viewing.

## Installation

1. Make sure the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 Redistribution" has been installed. If not, please download it from [https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) and install before continuing with instructions.
2. Double click the "tr-stereo-sdk.unitypackage" to import the plugin into a Unity project.
3. Open any one sample in Assets/TR Stereo/Samples/ to see how to setup and use the stereo components.
4. To create your own stereo camera from scratch, please drag and drop the "StereoV9Camera.prefab", which is placed in Assets/TRStereo/Prefabs/, into the scene

## Sample Projects

The SDK includes four samples located in the “Assets/TRStereo/Samples” folder. Each sample serves a specific purpose, showcasing different functionalities of the SDK. Here are brief descriptions of each sample:

### Sample 1: Verification

This sample is used to verify the functionality of "tr-stereo-sdk". Press the play button on Unity, and the rainbow color will show up on the game window. its color will change sequentially according to the angle between your eyes and the screen.

If you don't see any result like the above, please contact us.

### Sample 2: Numbers

TopRoot's autostereoscopic screen is a 9-view display. When you sit in the view-zone at the optimal distance (the “eyebox”), the whole screen shows exactly one view. Once away from the optimal distance, the image shows parts of various views, with increasing numbers of views as you get farther from the optimal distance.

In this sample, we demonstrate the description above. Each view is assigned a number from 1 to 9. You will see a different combination of numbers show up on the screen according to the position you sit. For instance, the screenshot below, tells us the current autostereoscopic is combined from view 6, 5 and 3 plus a little 2.

### Sample 3: Cars

This sample shows what the stereo perception is.

In the inspector of Stereov9Camera, there is a variable call "scene depth". It controls how the stereo perception of a car is affected. As shown in the image below, when adjusting the "scene depth" variable, the red-rectangle shown in the scene-view window will move closer to or back away from the camera.

We call this red-rectangle, "zero-plane".

The distance between the camera and the zero-plane is commonly referred to as 'scene depth' and is also known as 'convergence.' In general, the zero-plane divides the stereo perception into three regions:

1. At the Screen 
Objects aligned with the red-rectangle won't give any stereo perception.
2. Out of the Screen
Objects placed between the red-rectangle and the camera show stereo perception seemingly popping out of the screen.
3. In the Screen
If objects are placed behind the red-rectangle, the stereo perception makes objects look like they're moving deeper into the screen.

### Sample 4: Raw Images

This example demonstrates how to utilize a stereo image generated by StereoV9Camera on UGUI. 

To begin, create an empty render texture in the Assets folder. Next, assign this render texture as the target texture of the camera component. Finally, set this render texture as the source for the raw image component of UGUI.
