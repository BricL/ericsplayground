# 關於Codec

## Codec 與 Container 間的關係

- Codec
    - Ex: H.264/H.265/VP9/AV1
    - codec (short for coder-decoder) is a software or hardware algorithm that is responsible for encoding (compressing) and decoding (decompressing) audio or video data. Codecs determine the specific method of data compression and decompression used, which affects the file size, quality, and compatibility of the audio or video stream.
- Container
    - Ex: MP4/AVI/MOV/FLV/WebM
    - In the Container, different audio and video codecs can be used to encode the respective audio and video streams within the container. For example, an MP4 file can contain an H.264-encoded video stream and an AAC-encoded audio stream.

## Codec for Video Streaming

### H.264/AVC

- 老規格但支援廣，缺少 4K/UHD 解析度
- Pors
    - Wide Compatibility
    - Established Standard
    - Efficient Compression
    - Real-Time Encoding
- Cons
    - Compression Efficiency Limitations
        - H.264 is efficient, but not as advanced as newer codecs like H.265 (HEVC) or AV1, which can achieve similar or higher quality video at lower bitrates.
    - Bandwidth Requirements
        - Although H.264 is optimized for efficient compression, it may still require relatively higher bandwidth compared to more advanced codecs.
    - Patent Licensing
    - Limited Support for Higher Resolutions
        - Although H.264 supports different resolutions, it may not be as efficient or high quality for higher resolutions like 4K or UHD video as newer codecs designed for these resolutions.

### H.265/HEVC

- H264 的加強版
- Pros
    - Improved Compression Efficiency
        - H.265 offers significantly improved compression efficiency compared to H.264.
    - High-Quality Video
        - Due to its improved compression algorithms, H.265 can deliver higher-quality video with reduced artifacts and improved detail retention compared to H.264.
    - Flexibility in Bitrate Adaptation
        - H.265's improved compression efficiency allows for more efficient bitrate adaptation.
    - Future-Proofing
- Cons
    - Higher Processing Requirements
        - H.265 encoding and decoding typically require more computational power compared to H.264.
    - Limited Device Compatibility
        - H.265 support has grown, but it may still have compatibility problems with older devices that don't have hardware decoding capabilities.
    - Patent Licensing
    - Transition Challenges
        - Transitioning from H.264 to H.265 may require upgrading hardware, ensuring software support, and addressing compatibility issues with existing infrastructure.

### VP9

- Google的親兒子，免授權費用，對於影音格式支援較少一點比起其他新一代的 codec
- Pros
    - Improved Compression Efficiency
        - VP9 offers superior compression efficiency compared to older codecs like H.264.
    - High-Quality Video
        - Due to its advanced compression algorithms, VP9 can deliver high-quality video with improved detail retention and reduced artifacts.
    - Widely Supported
        - VP9 is widely supported by major web browsers like Chrome and Firefox, as well as various hardware devices such as smart TVs and streaming platforms, enhancing its compatibility and accessibility for online video streaming.
    - Royalty-Free Licensing
- Cons
    - Higher Processing Requirements
    - Limited Hardware Support
        - While VP9 support has grown, it may still face limited compatibility with some older devices and platforms. Hardware decoding capabilities may not be available on all devices, potentially leading to playback issues or increased power consumption for software decoding.
    - Bandwidth Considerations
        - While VP9 offers improved compression efficiency, it may still require higher bandwidth compared to more advanced codecs like H.265 or AV1. This can be a consideration for applications with limited bandwidth availability or for optimizing streaming services.
    - Transition Challenges

### AV1

- Pros
    - Improved Compression Efficiency
        - AV1 offers significantly improved compression efficiency compared to older codecs like H.264 and even newer codecs like VP9.
    - High-Quality Video
    - Royalty-Free Licensing
    - Future-Proofing
- Cons
    - Higher Processing Requirements
    - Limited Hardware Support
    - Encoding Time
        - AV1 encoding tends to be more computationally intensive, requiring longer encoding times compared to some other codecs. This can impact the workflow and time-to-market for content creators and providers.
    - Transition Challenges

### Codec 比較

1. Compression Efficiency: 
Codecs like H.265 (HEVC) and AV1 generally offer better compression efficiency compared to H.264, meaning they can achieve similar video quality at lower bitrates or higher video quality at the same bitrates. This is particularly important for streaming services aiming to deliver high-quality video while optimizing bandwidth usage.
2. Device Compatibility: 
H.264 has been widely adopted and is compatible with a broad range of devices, including older devices and platforms. It is considered a safe choice for ensuring compatibility across various devices. On the other hand, newer codecs like H.265, VP9, and AV1 may require more processing power or specific hardware support on the playback devices.
3. Licensing and Royalties: 
H.264 and VP9 have patent licensing requirements, while AV1 is a royalty-free codec. The licensing considerations can impact the cost and feasibility of using a particular codec, especially for large-scale streaming services.
4. Industry Adoption and Support: 
H.264 has been widely used for many years and has a vast ecosystem of hardware and software support. VP9 and AV1 have gained traction in recent years, with increasing support from major streaming platforms, browsers, and hardware manufacturers.

## Protocol for Video Streaming

- Application Layer Protocols:
    - WebRTC
    - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The foundational protocol for communication on the World Wide Web, used for fetching resources such as web pages, images, and videos.
    - HLS (HTTP Live Streaming): A streaming protocol developed by Apple, which segments media files and delivers them over HTTP. It is commonly used for adaptive bitrate streaming.
    - RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol): An application-level protocol developed by Adobe for real-time streaming of audio, video, and data over the internet.
    - RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol): An application-layer protocol used for controlling the delivery of streaming media, such as audio and video, over IP networks.
- Transport Layer Protocols:
    - QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections): A transport layer protocol developed by Google. It provides a secure, low-latency connection over UDP and can be used for various applications, including video streaming.
