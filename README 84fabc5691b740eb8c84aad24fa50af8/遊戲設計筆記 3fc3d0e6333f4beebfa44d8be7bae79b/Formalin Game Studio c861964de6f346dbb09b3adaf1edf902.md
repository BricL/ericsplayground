# ODM Project

## Baseball Warriors

Baseball Warriors is the first sport simulation idle game in the world. The basic idea here is that you are the manager of a baseball team composed entirely of characters from the popular Chinese Romance Of The Three Kingdoms stories. In most of the game’s modes, you don’t actually control any of your players. Instead, you choose who you want in each position on the field and the game will play out for you. It’s pretty hands-off, but if you want to get in on the action, there’s a Homerun Derby mode where you get to control the batter.
